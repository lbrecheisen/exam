# Exam

## Instructions
In C#, write a program that parses a sentence and replaces each word with the following: first letter, number of distinct characters between first and last character, and last letter. For example, Smooth would become S3h. Words are separated by spaces or non-alphabetic characters and these separators should be maintained in their original form and location in the answer.

The code must be syntactically correct and build in visual studio, either as a console or winforms application.
